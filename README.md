# What-maker
This repo contains my first deployed computer vision model. The model was trained to discriminate between 'Mercedes' and 'Honda' cars. It takes a picture input and classifies it.
The model is pretty crude but that is not the catch. The real catch is the deployment on Huggingface spaces.
Check out the latest user-end here: https://oluyemitosin-honda-or-mercedes.hf.space/
This repo doesn't contain all you need to run the model online.It only contains the training notebook and the gradio app script that Huggingface spaces runs.
